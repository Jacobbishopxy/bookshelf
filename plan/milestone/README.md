# Milestones

Each set of code changes should be recorded as a new file in this folder.

Rules:
- One file per change-set (small/medium PR-sized chunk).
- Use checkboxes: `[ ]` for not done, `[x]` for done.
- Keep entries concrete (files touched, behavior added, tests run).
- When a change-set is complete, all items in its file should be `[x]`.
